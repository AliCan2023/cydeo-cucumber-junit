    /*
Cucumber is a testing tool that allows you to write and execute automated acceptance tests in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style.
Here's how you can use Cucumber in a Java project:

Add Cucumber dependency to your project: To use Cucumber in your Java project, you need to add the Cucumber dependency to your project's build file
(e.g. pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle). You can find the latest version of the Cucumber dependency on the Cucumber website.
Write feature files: In Cucumber, you write tests in the form of feature files using the Gherkin syntax.
A feature file describes a particular feature of your application and includes scenarios that describe how the feature should behave.
Each scenario consists of a set of steps that can be executed by the Cucumber test runner.
Implement step definitions: Once you have written your feature files, you need to implement step definitions in Java that correspond to the steps in your feature files.
Step definitions are the code that Cucumber executes to perform the actions described in the feature files. Each step in a scenario must have a corresponding step definition.
Run Cucumber tests: You can run your Cucumber tests from the command line using the Cucumber test runner or from your IDE by configuring a Cucumber run configuration.
When you run your tests, Cucumber reads your feature files, matches the steps in each scenario to their corresponding step definitions, and executes the tests.
Here's an example of a feature file and its corresponding step definition:

     */
    /*
    //Feature file (example.feature):

Feature: Example feature
  Scenario: Example scenario
    Given I have 3 cucumbers in my fridge
    When I eat 1 cucumber
    Then I should have 2 cucumbers in my fridge
     */

    /*
    public class chatGPFeatureEgStepDefinition {

        private int cucumbers;

        @Given("I have (\\d+) cucumbers in my fridge")
        public void i_have_cucumbers_in_my_fridge(int n) {
            cucumbers = n;
        }

        @When("I eat (\\d+) cucumber")
        public void i_eat_cucumber(int n) {
            cucumbers -= n;
        }

        @Then("I should have (\\d+) cucumbers in my fridge")
        public void i_should_have_cucumbers_in_my_fridge(int n) {
          // assertEquals(n, cucumbers);
        }
    }
    /*
    In this example, the step definitions use regular expressions to match the steps in the feature file and perform the corresponding actions.
    The @Given, @When, and @Then annotations specify the type of step (given, when, or then) and the regular expression that matches the step.
    The cucumbers variable stores the current number of cucumbers in the fridge, and the step definitions modify this variable to simulate the actions described in the scenario.
    Finally, the assertEquals method is used to check that the expected number of cucumbers is present in the fridge after the actions are performed.
